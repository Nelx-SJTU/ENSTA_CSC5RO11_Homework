This repository contains the homework submissions for the ENSTA_CSC5RO11 course. Below is an overview of each homework assignment and its implementation details. Feel free to explore the individual folders for each homework task and refer to the respective `README.md` files for specific details on their implementations.

## Homework Overview

### Homework1: The Telephone Game
In this assignment, a game of "Telephone" is simulated using ROS (Robot Operating System). Four ROS nodes (A, B, C, D) pass a message through a chain, with each node modifying the message before forwarding it. Node A initiates and concludes the communication loop. The implementation demonstrates basic ROS communication with publishers and subscribers.

### Homework2: Facial Expression Classification
This project implements a facial expression recognition system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for feature extraction, as well as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project is located in src/homework_2.

### Homework3: Reinforcement Learning Policy Optimization
In this assignment, we explore reinforcement learning by analyzing optimal policies for various states in a given environment. We utilize an iterative approach to evaluate value functions, aiming to maximize rewards through strategic action selection. The report details the methodology, code, and results, ultimately presenting an optimal policy for each state.

### Homework4: Bayesian Network
This homework builds a Bayesian network to aid in diagnosing tuberculosis, cancer, and bronchitis, based on factors like smoking, recent travel to Asia, and test results (X-ray and stethoscope). Initial probabilities suggest some of the diseases, but diagnostic tests are used to refine this. The assignment demonstrates how Bayesian updating with new test results can enhance diagnostic accuracy.
