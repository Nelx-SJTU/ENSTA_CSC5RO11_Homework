This repository contains the homework submissions for the ENSTA_CSC5RO11 course. Below is an overview of each homework assignment and its implementation details. Feel free to explore the individual folders for each homework task and refer to the respective `README.md` files for specific details on their implementations.

## Homework Overview

### TP1: The Telephone Game
In this assignment, a game of "Telephone" is simulated using ROS (Robot Operating System). Four ROS nodes (A, B, C, D) pass a message through a chain, with each node modifying the message before forwarding it. Node A initiates and concludes the communication loop. The implementation demonstrates basic ROS communication with publishers and subscribers.

### TP2: [Facial Expression Classification]
This project implements a facial expression recognition system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for feature extraction, as well as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project is located in src/homework_2.

### TP3: [To be added]
Details of the TP3 assignment will be added here once the task is completed.
